Men sense the feeling and then switch to a different part of the brain in order to solve the problem. Women sense the feelings and stay with it which helps with nurturing and empathy. It's called the "tend-and-befriend" response to stress.

They hail  Marshawn as if he is the best thing to happen to them since sliced bread! This is Tom Brady's 6th appearance at the SUPERBOWL and he is so respectful of his opponents! That's character! The young man has been praising his opponents since the week started. That's class‚ùóÔ∏è  As for the Legion of Boom; this is only their second SB appearance (understandably back-2-back) and they're so heady?

It is immoral to send our troops into battle when we're not committed deeply to the outcome.  The next time we go to war we need to increase our taxes to pay for the direct (e.g.; gas; ammo; payroll) and indirect (e.g.; PTSD; vet benefits)  costs we incur as a result.  Let's see where that leaves the conversation and decision.

It was disrespectful to the league and be corporate organization he supposedly works for!   Every serious profession has rules. I am thinking and talking as as a lawyer now; there are some things you cannot say or do; and your silence for that matter would be tantamount to acquiescence (acceptance of the folly of not saying something when you are; by virtue of your profession; expected to say something).   I have been very very vexed by the way the media has made excuses for him by suggesting that he's being forced to speak when he is not used to talking. Excuse me; the man who "lambasted" the press today for holding their traditional pre-SUPERBOWL press conference; is a talker! Marshawn Lynch talks!!!   Talking to the press is a job description and or expectation; excuse me ESPN; it is not something "extracurricular;" it is nothing at all cumbersome. The NFL is not forcing its employees or players to talk for them sake of talking. It's all part of the preps towards the big day!  And since when do employees tell their employees what they like opposed to their employer's rules? I am a labor and emolument lawyer and I know what I am talking about. What this young man has been showcasing on national TV since the pre-Super Bowl activities started is the antithesis of submission to the corporation he's expected to represent.  As a matter of fact; he is the worst ambassador or emissary this pro-org has ever had! Marshall Lynch needs to be called out. I am appalled at the SeaHawks organization in its entirety: where is the owner? where are the coaches? where are the front office people that ought to call this young man to order? What if everyone else in the league is allowed to act this way? Imagine Tom Brady or Russell Wilson acting this way? There'd be a floodgate with the adverse effect remote-controlling other players to do likewise and the ultimate result is that the press and the fans and the country at large; in fact the world; would be put at a place where they can't and won't hear from the players!   It is a total sham! This man has a very horrible attitude that should not be excused by some in the press and certainly not by his coaches! If he is like this with the press; I wonder what he is behind closed doors with his coaches and fellow team mates. Don't excuse his nastiness by attributing it to the fact that he is a fantastic player! Excuse me ML; you're not the first player to be great at what they do! Imagine all the great hall-of-famers and awesome past players who played this game better than you; young man!!! The whole thing is just a show!   Marshawn Lynch is arrogant; plain and simple; he is a fruit of this organization that is arrogant and that fact is manifested by the actions and words of their players since the week started!   I just want them to be humbled! I so want them to be humbled or else they'd be humiliated! We'll see! This is far from being funny... IT IS STUPID and unconscionable!

What would you advise they do?  Spend the $5k or get started repaying their credit cards?  I've heard the whole "haven't you ever borrowed money to make money?" argument.  Yes; I've borrowed a LOT of money to make more money...  and I've PAID IT OFF.  Worse; I have little confidence that any spending the government does is going to come back in higher tax receipts which would pay back the original investment.
